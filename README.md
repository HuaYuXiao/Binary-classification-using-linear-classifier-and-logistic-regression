Consider the binary classification problem with one set of images labeled “empty” and the other set of images labeled “occupied” (Images are given in two folders in the attached data01.zip).

1. For the image samples from data01.zip, write a Class called ImageEODataset with each image as the input and the binary label as the target (you can let 0 for the “empty” label and 1 for the “occupied” label).
2. Use DataLoader to make a training set called train_loader and a validation set called validation_loader.
3. Create a linear classifier model, choose a loss function, and train the model by PyTorch. Compute the metrics (recall, precision, and F1 score) for both the training set and the validation set. 
4. Create a logistic regression model, choose a loss function, and train the model by PyTorch. Compute the metrics (recall, precision, and F1 score) for both the training set and the validation set. 
5. Compare the metrics from both models, and provide some discussion and conclusions.
